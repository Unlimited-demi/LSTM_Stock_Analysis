## Introduction

Stock analysis plays a crucial role in financial decision-making. This LSTM model is developed to analyze historical stock data and make predictions for future stock prices. The model uses Keras, a high-level deep learning API, to construct and train the neural network.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-analysis-lstm.git
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your historical stock data.
Adjust hyperparameters and model architecture if needed.
Train the model:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Evaluate the model and make predictions.
Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of multiple layers, including LSTM layers for capturing temporal dependencies, dropout layers to prevent overfitting, and dense layers for final predictions. The model architecture can be found in the train_model.py file.

python
Copy code
# Model Architecture Example
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=(timesteps, features)))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1))
Hyperparameters
Adjustable hyperparameters can significantly impact the model's performance. The hyperparameters, including learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, dropout rate, etc., can be modified in the train_model.py file.

python
Copy code
# Hyperparameters Example
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 50
batch_size = 32
dropout_rate = 0.2
Data
Ensure your historical stock data is in the appropriate format. The data directory contains sample data files for reference.
